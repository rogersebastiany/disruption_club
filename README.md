# Disruption Club

This repository contains the source code for the "Disruption Club" application, an exclusive, invite-only platform for fostering disruptive business ideas.

## Project Overview

The Disruption Club is a mobile application built on four core pillars:

1.  **Decentralized Identity:** Membership is managed via NFTs on the Polygon blockchain.
2.  **AI-Native Experience:** A Gemini-powered AI analyzes meeting discussions to automatically build and update a member's personal "idea map."
3.  **Offline-First:** The app is designed to work primarily offline, with connectivity enabled only during meetings.
4.  **Secure:** It uses a "secure enclave" model on AWS to protect sensitive data.

For a complete technical overview, please see the [Development Plan](development_plan.md).

## Development Status

This project is in the initial development phase. The immediate next step is to build the smart contract foundation. For a detailed list of tasks, see [tasks.md](tasks.md).
